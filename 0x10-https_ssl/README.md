DNS
Basics
DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP:

The root domain and sub domain - differences
A root domain is the parent domain to a sub domain, and its name is not, and can not be divided by a dot.

While creating any domain at a website of domain provider, the provider system will always ask you to choose a domain name without a dot in the name. In other words, the address of the root domain may be mydomain.com but it can never be my.domain.com. Domain providers block the ability to create such a root domain until you type a name without the dot. Why?

The dot in the domain name delimits the sub domain name (the part of the name before the dot, eg. www.my.) and the root domain name ( the part after the dot, ie .domain.com). This means that the address my.domain.com is a sub domain of the root domain, whose name is domain.com

In an administrator panel at domain provider account, you can create any number of sub domains. This means that for the root domain called domain.com it is possible to create different sub domains eg. my.domain.com, your.domain.com, school.domain.com… Creating multiple sub domains is always free and does not require you to set up new accounts on a domain provider website.

As you can see, all of the domain addresses used as an example (above) do not start with the www prefix. www is also a sub domain. The www prefix always leads to the main domain. See: What’s the point in having www in a url?

Web stack debugging
Intro
Debugging usually takes a big chunk of a software engineer’s time. The art of debugging is tough and it takes years, even decades to master, and that is why seasoned software engineers are the best at it… experience. They have seen lots of broken code, buggy systems, weird edge cases and race conditions.



Non-exhaustive guide to debugging
School specific
If you are struggling to get something right that is run on the checker, like a Bash script or a piece of code, keep in mind that you can simulate the flow by starting a Docker container with the distribution that is specified in the requirements and by running your code. Check the Docker concept page for more info.

Test and verify your assumptions
The idea is to ask a set of questions until you find the issue. For example, if you installed a web server and it isn’t serving a page when browsing the IP, here are some questions you can ask yourself to start debugging:

Is the web server started? - You can check using the service manager, also double check by checking process list.
On what port should it listen? - Check your web server configuration
Is it actually listening on this port? - netstat -lpdn - run as root or sudo so that you can see the process for each listening port
It is listening on the correct server IP? - netstat is also your friend here
Is there a firewall enabled?
Have you looked at logs? - usually in /var/log and tail -f is your friend
Can I connect to the HTTP port from the location I am browsing from? - curl is your friend
There is a good chance that at this point you will already have found part of the issue.

Youtube video First 5 Commands When I Connect on a Linux Server

When you connect to a server/machine/computer/container you want to understand what’s happened recently and what’s happening now, and you can do this with 5 commands in a minute or less:

w
shows server uptime which is the time during which the server has been continuously running
shows which users are connected to the server
load average will give you a good sense of the server health - (read more about load here and here)
history
shows which commands were previously run by the user you are currently connected to
you can learn a lot about what type of work was previously performed on the machine, and what could have gone wrong with it
where you might want to start your debugging work
top
shows what is currently running on this server
order results by CPU, memory utilization and catch the ones that are resource intensive
df
shows disk utilization
netstat
what port and IP your server is listening on
what processes are using sockets
try netstat -lpn on a Ubuntu machine
Machine
Debugging is pretty much about verifying assumptions, in a perfect world the software or system we are working on would be working perfectly, the server is in perfect shape and everybody is happy. But actually, it NEVER goes this way, things ALWAYS fail (it’s tremendous!).

For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

Does the server have free disk space? - df
Is the server able to keep up with CPU load? - w, top, ps
Does the server have available memory? free
Are the server disk(s) able to keep up with read/write IO? - htop
If the answer is no for any of these questions, then that might be the reason why things are not going as expected. There are often 3 ways of solving the issue:

free up resources (stop process(es) or reduce their resource consumption)
increase the machine resources (adding memory, CPU, disk space…)
distributing the resource usage to other machines
Network issue
For the machine level, you want to ask yourself these questions:

Does the server have the expected network interfaces and IPs up and running? ifconfig
Does the server listen on the sockets that it is supposed to? netstat (netstat -lpd or netstat -lpn)
Can you connect from the location you want to connect from, to the socket you want to connect to? telnet to the IP + PORT (telnet 8.8.8.8 80)
Does the server have the correct firewall rules? iptables, ufw:
iptables -L
sudo ufw status
Process issue
If a piece of Software isn’t behaving as expected, it can obviously be because of above reasons… but the good news is that there is more to look into (there is ALWAYS more to look into actually).

Is the software started? init, init.d:
service NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status
/etc/init.d/NAME_OF_THE_SERVICE status
Is the software process running? pgrep, ps:
pgrep -lf NAME_OF_THE_PROCESS
ps auxf
Is there anything interesting in the logs? look for log files in /var/log/ and tail -f is your friend
Debugging is fun
Debugging can be frustrating, but it will definitely be part of your job, it requires experience and methodology to become good at it. The good news is that bugs are never going away, and the more experienced you become, trickier bugs will be assigned to you! Good luck :)
